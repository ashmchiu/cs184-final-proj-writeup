## What We've Accomplished
<img src="../assets/milestone/adhesion.png" width="30%" align="right" />

We've built out a **particle model** based on Homework 4's `PointMass` class, constructing a scene with a sphere of `PointMass`es hovering over a `Sphere` `CollisionObject`. Then, simulating honey fluid dynamics using [Modeling and Rendering Viscous Liquids](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=bdbe45284686a54f3284fdf98759f099e3a95e84) as a reference, we implemented 
- **liquid-solid interactions** so honey sticks to the sphere,
- **liquid-liquid interactions** for viscous honey particles, and 
- refined **interpenetration prevention and volume preservation** to prevent a 2D-ification of the honey as it pools on the plane.

At first, our simulations were effectively unrunnable (buffering at every frame). We utilized spatial hashing for neighbor particle searching and incorporated **OpenMP parallelization** to fix this. Parallelizing neighbor search and particle-sphere collision at every timestep had the most impact.

## Preliminary Results
TODO

## Reflections
Reflecting on our current simulations, we like TODO 

However, we'd like to fix TODO

## Updated Work Plan
We want to focus more time on making our viscosity models more realistic than originally intended so we've limited dripping honey on just the sphere since it demonstrates honey-solid adhesion well. Our first goal is to **tune particle movements** to be more realistic. Then, while we've built out particle simulation in Homework 4 infrastructure, to replicate the visual experience of honey, we need to use **[marching cubes](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/seminar/lorenson-and-cline-1987.pdf) and port meshes into Blender**. Then, we simulate the texture of honey with a **BSDF**, **ray trace shadows**, and make honey reflect and **refract environments** (stretch goal). Our updated schedule is
- **Week 2 (4/14-4/20)**: Tweak adhesion and viscosity values to be more realistic and finish volume preservation. Complete marching cubes and capture meshes at different timesteps. 
- **Week 3 (4/21-4/28)**: Parse produced `.obj` files from marching cubes through [Stop-motion-OBJ](https://github.com/neverhood311/Stop-motion-OBJ). Import mesh sequence into Blender, add BSDF for honey.
- **Week 4 (4/28 - 5/4)**: Ray trace shadows in Blender. Refract the environment through honey (stretch goal given time). Prepare and practice for the final presentation.
