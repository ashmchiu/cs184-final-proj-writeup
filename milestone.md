## What We've Accomplished
<img src="../assets/milestone/adhesion.png" width="25%" align="right" />

Building a **particle model** based on Homework 4's `PointMass` class, we constructed a scene with a sphere of `PointMass`es hovering over a `Sphere` `CollisionObject`. Then, simulating fluid dynamics referencing [Modeling and Rendering Viscous Liquids](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=bdbe45284686a54f3284fdf98759f099e3a95e84), we implemented 
- **liquid-solid interactions** so honey sticks to the sphere
- **liquid-liquid interactions** for viscous honey particles 

At first, our simulations were effectively unrunnable (buffering at every frame). We utilized spatial hashing for neighbor particle searching and incorporated **OpenMP parallelization** to fix this. Parallelizing neighbor search and particle-sphere collision at every timestep had the most impact.

## Preliminary Results

Using 90 frames/second, 30 steps/frame, and 20,000 particles. A higher resolution version is on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/XzGDkuJSUBg).

## Reflections
In our current simulations, we like that the particles are attracted to the sphere, wrapping around rather than falling straight down. However, we'd like to fix a few things in **particle movements**:
- **volume preservation**: preserve density across honey particles. The particles are treated discretely so there's a 2D-ification of honey as it pools flatly at the bottom on the plane, but it should coil.
- **snail trail**: particles should mushroom out before colliding with the sphere ([reference](/assets/proposal/honey_on_sphere.png)), but they immediately hit the sphere unnaturely with a few sparse particles trickling down.

## Updated Work Plan
We want to focus more time on making our viscosity models more realistic than originally intended so we've limited dripping honey on just the sphere since it demonstrates honey-solid adhesion well. Our first goal is to **tune particle movements and volume preservation**. Then, while we've built out particle simulation in Homework 4 infrastructure, to replicate the visual experience of honey, we will **use [marching cubes](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/seminar/lorenson-and-cline-1987.pdf)** and **port meshes into Blender**. Then, we simulate the texture of honey with a **BSDF**, **ray trace shadows**, and make honey reflect and **refract environments** (stretch goal). Our updated schedule is
- **Week 2 (4/14-4/20)**: Tweak adhesion and viscosity values to be more realistic, implement volume preservation. Complete marching cubes and capture meshes at different timesteps. 
- **Week 3 (4/21-4/28)**: Parse produced `.obj` files from marching cubes through [Stop-motion-OBJ](https://github.com/neverhood311/Stop-motion-OBJ). Import mesh sequence into Blender, add BSDF for honey.
- **Week 4 (4/28 - 5/4)**: Ray trace shadows in Blender. Refract the environment through honey (stretch goal given time). Prepare and practice for the final presentation.
